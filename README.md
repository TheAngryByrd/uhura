This is a super simple url router for Owin/Kestrel.  It's designed be super simple with use from F# for microservices.  If you need something more robust I suggest [Suave](https://suave.io/), [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) or [Asp.Net](https://www.asp.net/core)

In order to build run

    > build.cmd // on windows    
    $ ./build.sh  // on unix
